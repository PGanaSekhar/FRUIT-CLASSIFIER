# FRUIT-CLASSIFIER
This repository is for a machine learning project called Fruit Classification.

## About
The project's objective is to categorise various fruits, and to do that, I have used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) due to their high accuracy and preference for categorization scenarios.

## Dataset
- The dataset used for the project is avaliable on Kaggle.<br>
- Link for the dataset, <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits">Fruits 360</a> <br>
- The dataset choosen for the project is with 90483 images of 131 fruits and vegetables. Some of them are,
  <br>1. Apples (different varieties: Crimson Snow, Golden, Golden-Red, Granny Smith, Pink Lady, Red, Red Delicious)
  <br>2. Apricot
  <br>3. Avocado
  <br>4. Avocado ripe
  <br>5. Banana (Yellow, Red, Lady Finger)
  <br>6. Beetroot Red
  <br>7. Blueberry
  <br>8. Cactus fruit
  <br>9. Cantaloupe (2 varieties)
  <br>10. Carambula
  <br>11. Cauliflower
  <br>12. Cherry (different varieties, Rainier)
  <br>13. Cherry Wax (Yellow, Red, Black)
  <br>14. Chestnut
  <br>15. Clementine
  <br>and many more...
- Training set size: 63764 images (one fruit or vegetable per image).
- Test set size: 22688 images (one fruit or vegetable per image).
- Image size: 100x100 pixels

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Convolutional Neural Network, which is a type of deep learning algorithm commonly used in computer vision tasks such as image recognition, object detection, and image classification.
- CNNs are designed to automatically and adaptively learn hierarchical feature representations from input data.
- CNNs have been highly successful in various computer vision tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as image classification (e.g., ImageNet competition), object detection (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN), and semantic segmentation.
- They have also been applied in fields beyond computer vision, such as natural language processing and speech recognition.
- Some key concepts and components of CNNs are Convolutional Layer, Pooling Layer, Activation Function (like ReLU), Fully Connected Layer, Flattening, Dropout, Loss Function, Optimizer


## Prerequisites
- Download the dataset.
- Have the dataset in the location mentioned in the code.
